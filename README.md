# benchmarking-cpp

Light benchmarking environment, so you can test the speed of snippets of code on your machine!

During my bachelor's thesis, I needed to test the speed of some C++ functions, so that I could say the improvement you could get using AVX extension on Intel CPUs. 

Since I had some decent scripts to analyze execution time of snippets, I put all together inside this repo.
